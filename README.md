# ZddLines
A simultaneous solution to a constrained shortest and longest s-t path problem based on the zero-suppressed binary decision diagram

The folder Leg One contains experiments in solving common combinatorial problems,
including taking the intersection and getting the maximum and minimum weighted sets.

The folder Leg Two tackles solving the shortest and longest path problems for the Osaka Metro,
following a similar procedure as Leg One.

The folder Data contains the Osaka Metro network data and some tools for visualization.
